## Introduction to Amazon Web Scraping

In this 2025 updated guide, we will show you how to scrape Amazon product data, including names, pricing, ASIN, and more. You don‚Äôt need to write a single line of code to get started!

Amazon‚Äôs platform provides a wealth of product data for research, but it doesn‚Äôt offer an easy way to export this data directly into a spreadsheet for your business needs. Whether it‚Äôs competitor analysis, price comparison, or building an API for your project, web scraping is the solution.

## Scraping Amazon Product Data

Let‚Äôs scrape product data from Amazon. For this example, we‚Äôll extract data from Amazon‚Äôs results page for ‚Äúcomputer monitor‚Äù and dive into each product‚Äôs details for more information.

### Getting Started

1. **Download and install ParseHub**. This free tool will handle the scraping process for you.
2. Open ParseHub and click on ‚ÄúNew Project.‚Äù Paste the Amazon URL for your search term. For example: [Amazon computer monitors](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=computer+monitor). The page will render inside the app.

### Scraping Amazon Results Page

Here‚Äôs how to extract product names, prices, ratings, and other data from the search results page:

1. **Select product names:**
   - Click the product name of the first result on the page. It will highlight in green.
   - Click on the second product name to confirm all items are selected (highlighted in green).

2. **Name your selection:**
   - On the left sidebar, rename the selection to "product."
   - ParseHub will automatically extract product names and URLs.

3. **Extract prices and ratings:**
   - Use the "Relative Select" command to connect product names to their prices.
   - Repeat the process to extract star ratings and the number of reviews. Rename each selection appropriately.

**Pro Tip:** This method will extract image URLs but won‚Äôt download the actual images. For downloading images, check out this guide: [Scrape and Download Images](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/scrape-images-website).

Your project should now look like this:

### Scraping Product Details

To extract additional data like ASIN, screen size, and resolution, we‚Äôll navigate to each product page:

1. Rename the main template to `search_results_page` for clarity.
2. Use the "Click" command to click on product links and create a new template named `product_page`.
3. On the product page, select items under "Product Information," such as Screen Size. Rename this selection to "labels."
4. Use the "Conditional" command to filter specific items:
   - For example, to extract screen size: `$e.text.contains(‚ÄúScreen Size‚Äù)`.
5. Align your selections properly to ensure the data is extracted into separate columns.

Your final setup should look like this:

### Adding Pagination

To scrape multiple pages of search results:

1. Return to the `search_results_page` template.
2. Use the "Select" command to select the "Next" button at the bottom of the page. Rename this selection to `next_button`.
3. Use the "Click" command on the `next_button` and set it to navigate through additional pages (e.g., 9 more pages).

### Running and Exporting Your Project

Once your project is set up:

1. Click the "Get Data" button and select "Run."
2. After the scraping job completes, download the data as a spreadsheet or JSON file.

Your final exported data will look something like this:
