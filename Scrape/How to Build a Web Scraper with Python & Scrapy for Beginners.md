# How to Build a Web Scraper with Python & Scrapy for Beginners

## Introduction

Scrapy is an open-source Python framework designed for large-scale web scraping. It provides all the tools needed to extract, process, and store data from any website efficiently. With its ability to create custom spiders, manage data formats like JSON or CSV, and maintain scalable projects, Scrapy is one of the most powerful web scraping tools available.

If you've been wondering how to get started with Scrapy, this tutorial will guide you through the process step-by-step. Even if you're a complete beginner, you'll learn how to:

1. Install Scrapy on your machine.
2. Create a new Scrapy project.
3. Test selectors using Scrapy Shell.
4. Build a custom spider.
5. Extract specific data.
6. Export the scraped data to a JSON or CSV file.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional web scraper capable of crawling and extracting data efficiently.

## 1. How to Install Scrapy on Your Machine

The Scrapy framework is best installed in a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Open your command prompt and navigate to the directory where you'd like to create your virtual environment.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `scrapy_tutorial`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv scrapy_tutorial
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   scrapy_tutorial\scripts\activate.bat
   ```

4. Install Scrapy within the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install scrapy
   ```

And that's it! Your Scrapy installation is ready to use.

## 2. Create a Scrapy Project

1. Inside your virtual environment, navigate to the project directory and create a new Scrapy project:

   ```bash
   scrapy startproject scrapytutorial
   ```

2. This will automatically generate the necessary project structure, including folders for spiders, settings, and middleware.

   ```
   scrapytutorial/
       scrapy.cfg
       scrapytutorial/
           spiders/
           __init__.py
           items.py
           middlewares.py
           pipelines.py
           settings.py
   ```

## 3. Test Selectors with Scrapy Shell

Before creating your spider, it's important to test the selectors you'll use to scrape data from the target website. Scrapy Shell allows you to interactively inspect elements on a web page.

1. Launch Scrapy Shell and fetch the target URL:

   ```bash
   scrapy shell 'https://www.wine-selection.com/shop'
   ```

2. Use CSS or XPath selectors to extract elements. For example, to extract product names:

   ```python
   response.css('div.txt-wrap a::text').getall()
   ```

3. Refine your selectors until you're satisfied with the results.

## 4. Build a Custom Spider

Spiders are the core of any Scrapy project. Here's how to create a custom spider:

1. Inside the `spiders/` folder, create a new file called `winespider.py`.
2. Add the following code:

   ```python
   import scrapy

   class WinesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
       name = "winy"
       start_urls = ['https://www.wine-selection.com/shop']

       def parse(self, response):
           for wines in response.css('div.txt-wrap'):
               yield {
                   'name': wines.css('a::text').get(),
                   'price': wines.css('strong.price::text').get().replace('$ ', ''),
                   'link': wines.css('a').attrib['href'],
               }
   ```

3. Run your spider:

   ```bash
   scrapy crawl winy -o wines.json
   ```

This command will save the scraped data to a JSON file called `wines.json`.

## 5. Enable Pagination in Your Scraper

To scrape multiple pages, modify your spider to follow pagination links:

```python
def parse(self, response):
    for wines in response.css('div.txt-wrap'):
        yield {
            'name': wines.css('a::text').get(),
            'price': wines.css('strong.price::text').get().replace('$ ', ''),
            'link': wines.css('a').attrib['href'],
        }

    next_page = response.css('a[rel=next]').attrib['href']
    if next_page is not None:
        yield response.follow(next_page, callback=self.parse)
```

This will allow your spider to automatically crawl through multiple pages of results.

## 6. ScraperAPI Integration for Advanced Features

If you're working on a large project, you may face challenges like IP bans, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript-heavy websites. ScraperAPI can handle these issues for you.

### Using ScraperAPI with Scrapy

1. Import `urlencode` and define your ScraperAPI key:

   ```python
   from urllib.parse import urlencode

   API_KEY = 'SCRAPE9837861'

   def get_scraperapi_url(url):
       payload = {'api_key': API_KEY, 'url': url}
       return 'http://api.scraperapi.com/?' + urlencode(payload)
   ```

2. Modify your spider to send requests through ScraperAPI:

   ```python
   def start_requests(self):
       urls = ['https://www.wine-selection.com/shop']
       for url in urls:
           yield scrapy.Request(url=get_scraperapi_url(url), callback=self.parse)
   ```

This integration ensures that your scraper avoids detection and handles complex challenges like CAPTCHAs.
