## Why Scrape News?

In many scenarios, scraping Google News can help users achieve specific goals, such as:

- Tracking breaking news related to a particular event.
- Gathering sentiment and public opinion for data analysis.
- Building a personalized database of news content.
- Conducting SEO or marketing research based on trending keywords.

Unlike traditional tools, modern web scraping makes the process faster and more reliable. Here's how you can use Python to simplify and automate this task.

## How to Scrape Google News with Python

### Step 1: Use the `requests_html` Library for Web Access

The `requests_html` library is an excellent tool for fetching data from web pages. To begin, install the library by running the following command:

```bash
pip install requests_html
```

Then, import the library in your Python code:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession
```

### Step 2: Scrape News Titles

Here's a Python function to extract news titles from Google News based on a search term:

```python
def get_titles(search_term):
    session = HTMLSession()
    url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_term}&tbm=nws"
    response = session.get(url)
    titles = response.html.find('.nDgy9d')
    for title in titles:
        print(title.text)
```

**How it Works:**

1. Creates an `HTMLSession` object to send requests.
2. Constructs a Google News search URL using the given search term.
3. Extracts news titles from the HTML response using CSS selectors.

To use this function, pass your desired search term:

```python
get_titles("COVID-19 updates")
```

### Step 3: Customize Search Keywords

Modify the `search_term` parameter in your function to target specific topics or keywords. This allows you to scrape news tailored to your requirements.

For example:

```python
get_titles("Artificial Intelligence")
```

### Step 4: Use Google News API for Simplified Scraping

Instead of parsing HTML, you can use the Google News RSS feed for a more stable and reliable scraping solution. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

```python
import requests

def get_titles(search_term):
    url = f"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={search_term}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.text
    # Parse and extract titles and links from the RSS feed
```

Using Google News RSS ensures compatibility with Googleâ€™s service and avoids breaking due to website updates.

---

### Step 5: Restrict Search to Specific Regions

Google News allows you to filter news by language and region. This is done by appending the `hl` (language) and `gl` (region) parameters to your URL.

```python
def get_titles(search_term, language, country):
    url = f"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={search_term}&hl={language}&gl={country}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.text
    # Process data for titles and links
```

For example, to fetch UK-specific news about COVID-19:

```python
get_titles("COVID-19", "en", "GB")
```

---

## Parsing News Titles and Links

To extract both titles and links from the RSS feed, you can use the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to parse XML data:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def get_titles(search_term, language, country):
    url = f"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={search_term}&hl={language}&gl={country}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.text

    root = ET.fromstring(data)
    for item in root.iter("item"):
        title = item.find("title").text
        link = item.find("link").text
        print(f"Title: {title}")
        print(f"Link: {link}")
```

---

### Automate News Scraping with a Single Function

Finally, package everything into a single automated function that returns structured data:

```python
import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def scrape_news(search_term, language="en", country="US"):
    url = f"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={search_term}&hl={language}&gl={country}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.text

    root = ET.fromstring(data)
    news_list = []

    for item in root.iter("item"):
        news_item = {
            "title": item.find("title").text,
            "link": item.find("link").text
        }
        news_list.append(news_item)

    return news_list

# Example usage
results = scrape_news("Artificial Intelligence")
for news in results:
    print(f"Title: {news['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {news['link']}")
    print("---")
```

## Best Practices for News Scraping

1. **Follow Ethical and Legal Guidelines**: Always respect Googleâ€™s Terms of Service and avoid violating usage policies.
2. **Use Proxies**: To avoid IP bans, utilize proxies when sending multiple requests.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Implement error handling and request retries to handle failures gracefully.
4. **Monitor Changes**: Google may update its website structure, so regularly check your code for compatibility.
